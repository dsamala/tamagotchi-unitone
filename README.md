# tamagotchi-unitone

Objective:
To create a working game using elements of HTML, CSS, JS,and JQuery

Process:

1.) Create Wireframe 

![Wireframe Unit 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92316626/142738419-cc1a753b-4709-411a-ab3a-57b1e779d3b7.png)

  Breakdown:
  Three Sections
    A.) Selection
    B.) Main Page
    C.) Event Page
    
2.) User Story
  INITIAL PAGE 
  As a user:
    I should be able to name my pet
    I should be able to start the game
    
  
  MAIN PAGE
  As a user:
    > I should be able to see my pet's stats - to know what they need and care for them
      > I should be able to feed my pet
      > I should be able to let my pet sleep
      > I should be able to play with my pet
    > I should be able to see how old my pet is
  
  EVENT PAGE
  As a user: 
    I should be able to be notified that my pet is going through an event
      > If my pet is developing: I should see a animation of evolution
      > If my pet has died: I should be notified that my pet has died of parameter I was unable to take care of
    After said event, I should be able to:
      > Retry (because more chances!) if my pet has ended with an unfortunate event
      > Continue caring for my pet and further develop it
      
   
      
3.) Code Approach

  Object Oriented Programming 
    Initialize the tamagotchis as a preset object
    Properties of tamagotchi - name, hunger, sleep, boredom, age
    Actions are methods inside which are then called to continue playing the game
